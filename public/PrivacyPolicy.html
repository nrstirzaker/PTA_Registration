Friends of Christ’s College PTA will not give your information to any company, individual or organisation except where it’s required under the law of the United Kingdom. 
We take your youngest child year group so that we can contact you at that point to see if you would like to unregister as most members leave the PTA when their youngest child leaves.
Once the site is fully live you will be able to unregister using the site
If we do contact you and you would like to unregister please let us know
